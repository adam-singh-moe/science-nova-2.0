# Floating AI Chat - Format Improvements

## Issues Fixed
Based on the screenshot showing formatting problems with the floating chat widget:
1. Suggested question tabs were cut off at the bottom
2. Overall layout was too cramped
3. Components were competing for limited vertical space
4. Scrolling area was taking too much space

## Improvements Made

### 1. **Optimized Height Distribution**
```tsx
// ScrollArea: Reduced from h-60 (240px) to h-44 (176px)
<ScrollArea className="h-44 pr-2 mb-3 floating-chat-scroll-area">

// Total card height: 384px (h-96)
// Header: ~48px
// Chat messages: 176px (scrollable)
// Input area: ~160px (tabs + input + link + padding)
```

### 2. **Compact Question Tabs**
- **Height**: Reduced from `h-6` to `h-5` (24px → 20px)
- **Padding**: Reduced from `px-2 py-1` to `px-1.5 py-0.5`
- **Text length**: Reduced from 25 to 20 characters before truncation
- **Font size**: Reduced from 10px to 9px
- **Max width**: Added 120px constraint to prevent overflow

### 3. **Streamlined Input Area**
- **Input height**: Reduced from `h-8` to `h-7` (32px → 28px)
- **Send button**: Reduced from `h-8 w-8` to `h-7 w-7`
- **Spacing**: Reduced from `space-y-2` to `space-y-1.5`
- **Margins**: Reduced suggested questions margin from `mb-2` to `mb-1`

### 4. **Compact Full Chat Button**
- **Height**: Added explicit `h-6` (24px)
- **Icon size**: Reduced from `h-3 w-3` to `h-2.5 w-2.5`
- **Text**: Shortened from "Open Full Chat" to "Full Chat"

### 5. **Reduced Overall Padding**
- **Card content**: Reduced from `p-3` to `p-2` (12px → 8px padding)
- **Better space utilization** without affecting readability

## New Layout Breakdown

| Component | Height | Purpose |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Header | ~48px | Title, grade badge, controls |
| Chat Messages | 176px | Scrollable conversation area |
| Question Tabs | ~20px | Compact suggested questions |
| Input Field | ~28px | Message input and send button |
| Full Chat Link | ~24px | Navigation to main chat |
| Padding/Margins | ~88px | Internal spacing and structure |
| **Total** | **384px** | Complete floating chat widget |
