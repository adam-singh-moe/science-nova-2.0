Welcome to your first lesson on forces and motion! üöÄ

## Key Concept: What is a Force?

A force is simply a push or a pull. Forces are everywhere around us and they make things happen in our world!

## Fun Fact: Invisible Forces

Did you know that right now, gravity is pulling you toward the center of the Earth with a force equal to your weight? You can't see it, but it's always there!

## Interactive Diagram: Types of Forces

[This would show an interactive diagram with different force examples - a person pushing a box, gravity pulling an apple, friction slowing down a sliding object]

## Key Concept: Motion and Rest

Objects at rest tend to stay at rest, and objects in motion tend to stay in motion. This is called inertia!

## Fun Fact: Space Motion

In space, where there's no air resistance, a moving object would keep moving forever in the same direction unless something stops it!

## Practice Time

Think about these examples:
- Kicking a soccer ball (applied force)
- A book sitting on a table (gravity vs. normal force)  
- Rubbing your hands together (friction force)
