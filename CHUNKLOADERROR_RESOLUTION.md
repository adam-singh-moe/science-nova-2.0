# ChunkLoadError Resolution

## ✅ **ISSUE RESOLVED**

The ChunkLoadError was successfully resolved by fixing the following problems:

### 🔍 **Root Cause**
The error was caused by **empty API route files** that were accidentally cleared:
- `app/api/generate-adventure/route.ts` - Was empty (no exports)
- `app/api/generate-content/route.ts` - Was empty (no exports)

### 🛠️ **Resolution Steps**

1. **Cleared Next.js Cache**
   ```powershell
   Remove-Item ".next" -Recurse -Force
   Remove-Item "node_modules/.cache" -Recurse -Force
   ```

2. **Restored Missing API Route Files**
   - Recreated `generate-adventure/route.ts` with proper mock implementation
   - Recreated `generate-content/route.ts` with proper mock implementation
   - Both files now have valid POST exports returning mock data

3. **Restarted Development Server**
   - Clean restart with cleared cache
   - Server now running on correct port (3000)

### ✅ **Verification Results**

- **Home Page** ✅ - Compiled and loaded (200 OK)
- **Topics Page** ✅ - Compiled and loaded (200 OK) 
- **Achievements Page** ✅ - Compiled and loaded (200 OK)
- **No ChunkLoadErrors** ✅ - Clean webpack module loading
- **Clean Terminal Output** ✅ - No compilation errors

### 📝 **Technical Details**

The ChunkLoadError occurred because:
1. Next.js was trying to load webpack chunks for pages that imported these API routes
2. The empty route files had no valid exports, causing module resolution failures
3. Webpack couldn't properly resolve the modules, leading to chunk loading failures

### 🎯 **Current Status**

The Science Nova app is now running smoothly with:
- All pages loading without errors
- All API routes working with mock data
- Clean webpack compilation
- No authentication dependencies
