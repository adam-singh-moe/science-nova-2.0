# ✅ AUTHENTICATION REVERT COMPLETE - ALL ERRORS RESOLVED

## Issue Resolution Summary

The authentication errors have been **completely resolved**. The issue was that the `app/layout.tsx` file still contained:

1. ❌ `import { AuthProvider } from "@/hooks/use-auth"` - **REMOVED**
2. ❌ `<AuthProvider>` wrapper component - **REMOVED**

## What Was Fixed:

### Root Layout (`app/layout.tsx`):
- ✅ Removed `AuthProvider` import
- ✅ Removed `<AuthProvider>` wrapper from JSX
- ✅ Layout now renders children directly without authentication context

### Current State:
```tsx
// Before (causing errors):
import { AuthProvider } from "@/hooks/use-auth"
// ...
<AuthProvider>
  {children}
  <Toaster />
  <FloatingAIChat />
</AuthProvider>

// After (working):
// No AuthProvider import
// ...
{children}
<Toaster />
<FloatingAIChat />
```

## Verification Results:

### ✅ No More Authentication Errors:
- **No `useAuth` imports** found anywhere in codebase
- **No `AuthProvider` references** in active code
- **No authentication dependencies** remaining
