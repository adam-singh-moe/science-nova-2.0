# YouTube Video Tool Issues Fixed

## Problems Identified and Resolved

### 1. AI Helper Tools Still Present (✅ FIXED)
**Issue**: The video tool was showing AI helper controls (read aloud, zoom in/out) despite the requirement to exclude them.

**Solution**: Modified `components/tool-container.client.tsx` to conditionally show the `ToolActions` component:
- Added logic to hide AI helper tools when `variant === "video"`
- The `StudentToolCard` component already supports optional `actions` prop

**Code Change**:
```tsx
// Don't show AI helper tools for video variant
const showActions = variant !== "video"

return (
  <StudentToolCard
    variant={variant}
    bodyBgColor={bodyBgColor}
    actions={showActions ? <ToolActions targetRef={contentRef} /> : undefined}
  >
```

### 2. Video Display Inconsistency (✅ FIXED)
**Issue**: The video was not displaying properly in the lesson preview compared to the lesson builder, with sizing and aspect ratio problems.

**Solutions Applied**:

#### A. Updated YouTube Viewer Sizing
- Removed fixed `min-h-[300px]` constraints that were causing sizing issues
- Added proper aspect ratio handling with `aspectRatio: '16/9'` for non-fullscreen mode
- Set minimum height to `200px` with inline styles for better control

#### B. Enhanced CSS for Video Container
Added comprehensive CSS rules in `app/globals.css`:
```css
/* YouTube player responsive sizing */
.youtube-player {
  container-type: inline-size;
}

.youtube-player iframe {
  width: 100% !important;
  height: 100% !important;
  object-fit: cover;
}

/* Ensure video container fills available space */
.tool-content .youtube-player {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  min-height: 200px;
}

/* Override any conflicting styles that might constrain video size */
.tool-content {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  height: 100%;
}

.tool-content > div {
  flex: 1;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}
```

#### C. Improved Container Structure
- Made the tool content use flexbox layout to properly fill available space
- Ensured the YouTube player container takes full height of its parent
- Added container query support for responsive behavior
