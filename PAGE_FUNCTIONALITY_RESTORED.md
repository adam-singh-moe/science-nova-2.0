## üîß TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Database Integration
All pages now properly integrate with Supabase database:

```typescript
// User Progress Query (Home & Achievements)
const { data: progressData } = await supabase
  .from('user_progress')
  .select(`
    *,
    topics (
      title,
      study_areas (name)
    )
  `)
  .eq('user_id', user.id)

// Grade-Level Topic Filtering (Topics)
let topicsQuery = supabase
  .from('topics')
  .select(`
    id, title, grade_level,
    study_areas!inner (name, vanta_effect)
  `)

if (isAuthenticated && userGradeLevel) {
  topicsQuery = topicsQuery.eq('grade_level', userGradeLevel)
}
```

### Authentication Context Integration
All pages use the `useAuth` hook for:
- User authentication status
- Profile data (name, grade level, learning preference)
- Loading states
- Real-time auth updates

### Real-Time Data Calculations

#### Home Page Metrics
- **Topics Statistics**: Count of accessed vs completed topics
- **Study Areas**: Unique count of explored study areas
- **Time Estimation**: 15 minutes per topic access
- **Learning Streak**: Consecutive days with activity
- **Recent Activity**: Last 5 topics with completion status

#### Topics Page Filtering
- **Grade-Level Filtering**: Shows only topics matching user's grade
- **Search Functionality**: Filter by topic name or study area
- **Study Area Filter**: Group topics by subject area
- **Real-Time Updates**: Reflects user's current grade level

#### Achievements System
- **XP Calculation**: 10 XP per access + 50 XP per completion
- **Level System**: Level = floor(totalXP / 500) + 1
- **Achievement Unlocking**: Based on real progress thresholds
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress bars for incomplete achievements

## üéØ SPECIFIC FUNCTIONALITY RESTORED

### Home Page Features
1. **User Welcome**: "Welcome back, [Name]! You're currently in Grade X"
2. **Activity Statistics**: 4-card overview (Topics Explored, Completed, Study Areas, Time)
3. **Recent Activity**: List of last 5 topics with completion badges
4. **Quick Actions**: Navigation to main features
5. **Progress Summary**: Completion percentage and streak display
6. **Learning Streak Badge**: Highlighted when active streak exists

### Topics Page Features
1. **Grade-Level Header**: "Explore Grade X science topics tailored for your learning level"
2. **Automatic Filtering**: Only shows topics for user's grade level
3. **Search & Filter**: Find topics by name or subject area
4. **Topic Cards**: Show grade level, study area, and topic details
5. **Demo Mode Notice**: Explains grade-level filtering for unauthenticated users

### Achievements Page Features
1. **Level Display**: Current level with XP progress bar

3. **Progress Tracking**: Shows progress toward incomplete achievements
4. **Statistics Cards**: Level, XP, streak, topics completed
5. **Category Filtering**: Learning, Exploration, Consistency, Mastery achievements
6. **Visual Progress**: Progress bars and completion indicators

## üõ°Ô∏è Demo Mode Fallback

All pages gracefully handle unauthenticated users:
- **Mock Data**: Realistic sample data for demonstration
- **Sign-In Prompts**: Clear calls-to-action to authenticate
- **Feature Explanation**: Describes what users get when signed in
- **No Errors**: Smooth experience without authentication issues

## üîÑ Data Flow

### Authentication-Aware Data Loading
1. **Check Authentication**: `useAuth()` hook provides user state
2. **Conditional Queries**: Different queries for authenticated vs unauthenticated
3. **Real-Time Updates**: Data refreshes when auth state changes
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to mock data on API errors

### Grade-Level Integration
1. **Profile Grade**: Retrieved from user profile (`profile.grade_level`)
2. **Topic Filtering**: Database queries filtered by grade level
