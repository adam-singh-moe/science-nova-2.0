# Interactive Adventure Stories - Bug Fixes Complete

## üêõ ISSUES FIXED

### 1. **Duplicate Quiz Modal Issue**
**Problem**: Two quiz modals were being rendered simultaneously, causing an overlay effect.

**Root Cause**: There were two separate quiz modal components in the storybook component:
- One older "Quiz component - centered overlay" 
- One newer "Quiz Question Modal"

**Solution**: ‚úÖ **FIXED**
- Removed the duplicate/older quiz modal component
- Kept only the properly styled "Quiz Question Modal" with better UI/UX

### 2. **Quiz Reappearing After Completion**
**Problem**: After answering a quiz correctly and closing it, attempting to navigate to the next page would show the same quiz again.

**Root Cause**: The quiz completion state was only tracked with a boolean `quizAnswered` that was reset on page navigation, not tracking which specific page quizzes had been completed.

**Solution**: ‚úÖ **FIXED**
- Added `completedQuizzes` state using a Set to track completed quiz page IDs
- Updated `showQuizForCurrentPage()` to check if quiz for current page was already completed
- Modified `submitQuizAnswer()` to mark the current page's quiz as completed
- Updated `handlePageFlip()` to use the new completion tracking logic
- Fixed quiz button visibility to only show for incomplete quizzes

## üîß TECHNICAL CHANGES

### **State Management Improvements**
```typescript
// Added new state to track completed quizzes by page ID
const [completedQuizzes, setCompletedQuizzes] = useState<Set<string>>(new Set())

// Updated quiz logic to use completion tracking
const showQuizForCurrentPage = useCallback(() => {
  const currentPageData = enhancedPages[currentPage]
  if (currentPageData?.quizQuestion && !completedQuizzes.has(currentPageData.id)) {
    // Show quiz only if not already completed
  }
}, [currentPage, enhancedPages, completedQuizzes])
```

### **Page Navigation Logic**
```typescript
// Enhanced page flip handler
const handlePageFlip = useCallback((direction: "forward" | "backward") => {
  if (direction === "forward") {
    const currentPageData = enhancedPages[currentPage]
    // Only show quiz if page has one AND it hasn't been completed
    if (currentPageData?.quizQuestion && !completedQuizzes.has(currentPageData.id)) {
      showQuizForCurrentPage()
      return
    }
  }
  // Continue with normal navigation...
}, [currentPage, enhancedPages, completedQuizzes, ...])
```

### **UI Component Cleanup**
- **Removed**: Duplicate quiz modal with basic styling
- **Kept**: Enhanced quiz modal with:
  - Better visual design
  - Proper answer feedback (green/red colors)
  - Clear explanations
  - Responsive layout
