# Textbook References & Discussion Button Fixes - COMPLETED âœ…

## ðŸŽ¯ **Issues Resolved**

### **1. Textbook References Removed from Stories**
**Problem**: AI was mentioning textbook names and publisher information in generated stories
**Solution**: Enhanced AI prompt to explicitly exclude textbook references

#### **Before Fix:**
- Stories contained references like "According to McGraw-Hill textbook..."
- Publisher names appeared in story content
- ISBN numbers and educational source citations

#### **After Fix:**
- Stories contain natural adventure narratives without any textbook mentions
- Content focuses on discovery and exploration
- Educational information presented through character experiences

### **2. Discussion Button Auto-Display at Story End**
**Problem**: Discussion prompts needed to automatically appear at the end but be hidden behind a button
**Solution**: Implemented automatic button display with manual discussion activation

#### **Before Fix:**
- Discussion automatically popped up at story end
- No user control over when to start discussion

#### **After Fix:**
- Discussion button automatically appears when reaching the last page
- Button shows: "ðŸ’­ Let's Discuss What We Learned!"
- Discussion only starts when user clicks the button
- Users can control when they want to engage with discussion

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Implementation**

### **API Changes (route.ts)**
```typescript
// Enhanced curriculum content prompt
${contentContext ? `CURRICULUM CONTENT:
Use this grade-appropriate content to ensure scientific accuracy, but do NOT mention textbook names, publishers, or reference any specific books in the story:
${contentContext}

Important: Weave these concepts naturally into the adventure story without referencing any textbook names, publishers, or educational sources. Present the information as part of the natural discovery and adventure.
` : ''}
```

**Key Changes:**
- âœ… Explicit instruction to NOT mention textbook names or publishers
- âœ… Content presented as natural discovery rather than citations
- âœ… Educational accuracy maintained without source references

### **UI Changes (storybook-enhanced.tsx)**

#### **New State Management:**
```typescript
const [discussionButton, setDiscussionButton] = useState(false) // Show discussion button at the end
```

#### **Auto-Button Display Logic:**
```typescript
// At the end of the story, show discussion button instead of auto-opening discussion
if (discussionPrompts && !discussionButton) {
  setDiscussionButton(true)
}
```

#### **Discussion Button UI:**
```typescript
{/* Discussion button at the end of the story */}
{isLastPage && discussionButton && discussionPrompts && (
  <div className="mt-8 text-center">
    <Button
      onClick={startDiscussion}
      className="bg-purple-600 hover:bg-purple-700 text-white px-8 py-3 text-lg font-semibold rounded-2xl shadow-lg hover:shadow-xl transition-all duration-300 hover:scale-105"
    >
      ðŸ’­ Let's Discuss What We Learned!
    </Button>
  </div>
)}
```

#### **Enhanced useEffect for Button Display:**
```typescript
// Show discussion button when reaching the last page
if (isLastPage && discussionPrompts && !discussionButton) {
  setDiscussionButton(true)
}
```
