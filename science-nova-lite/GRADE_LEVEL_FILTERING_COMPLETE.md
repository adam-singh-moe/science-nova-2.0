# Grade-Level Content Filtering Implementation âœ…

## Summary
Successfully implemented grade-level content filtering for Science Nova's Discovery and Arcade systems. Students now see only age-appropriate content based on their profile grade level, while admins and teachers see all content regardless of their grade setting.

## âœ… Implementation Completed

### 1. API Endpoints Modified
- **`/api/discovery/daily/route.ts`** - Added grade filtering to daily Discovery content
- **`/api/arcade/daily/route.ts`** - Added grade filtering to daily Arcade content  
- **`/api/discovery/next/route.ts`** - Added grade filtering to Discovery shuffle endpoint
- **`/api/arcade/next/route.ts`** - Added grade filtering to Arcade shuffle endpoint

### 2. Grade Filtering Logic
- **Students**: See content from their grade level Â±1 (e.g., Grade 5 sees Grades 4-6)
- **Admin/Teacher/Developer**: See all content regardless of their profile grade level
- **Range Protection**: Grade ranges are bounded between 1-12 (no negative grades or > 12)

### 3. Frontend Integration
- **Discovery Page** (`app/discovery/page.tsx`): Updated to pass user_id to shuffle endpoint
- **Arcade Page** (`app/arcade/page.tsx`): Updated to pass user_id to shuffle endpoint
- **API Calls**: Both daily and next endpoints properly receive user context

### 4. Database Integration
- **Profile System**: Leverages existing profiles table with grade_level and role fields
- **Topic Filtering**: Joins topic_content_entries with topics table to filter by grade_level
- **Authentication**: Uses Supabase auth tokens to identify user and retrieve their profile

## ðŸ§ª Testing Results

### Content Distribution
- **Grade 4**: 3 Discovery items, 2 Arcade items (Space Exploration topic)
- **Grade 5**: 5 Discovery items, 3 Arcade items (Earth & Ocean Facts topic)  
- **Grade 6**: 3 Discovery items, 2 Arcade items (Chemistry topic)

### Filtering Validation
```
Grade 3 Student: 3 items (only Grade 4 content)
Grade 4 Student: 8 items (Grades 4-5 content)
Grade 5 Student: 11 items (Grades 4-6 content - sees all current content)
Grade 6 Student: 8 items (Grades 5-6 content)
Grade 7 Student: 3 items (only Grade 6 content)
Admin/Teacher: 11 items (all content regardless of profile grade)
```

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

### API Filtering Code Pattern
```typescript
// Get user profile and determine filtering
const { data: profile } = await userSupabase
  .from('profiles')
  .select('grade_level, role')
  .eq('id', user.id)
  .single();

const userRole = profile?.role || 'STUDENT';
const isPrivileged = userRole === 'ADMIN' || userRole === 'TEACHER' || userRole === 'DEVELOPER';

// Apply grade filtering for students
let query = userSupabase
  .from('topic_content_entries')
  .select(`*, topics!inner(*)`)
  .eq('category', category)
  .eq('status', 'published');

if (!isPrivileged && profile?.grade_level) {
  const minGrade = Math.max(1, profile.grade_level - 1);
  const maxGrade = Math.min(12, profile.grade_level + 1);
  query = query
    .gte('topics.grade_level', minGrade)
    .lte('topics.grade_level', maxGrade);
}
```

### Database Schema
- **profiles table**: Contains user grade_level and role
- **topics table**: Contains grade_level for each topic
- **topic_content_entries**: Content linked to topics via topic_id foreign key

## ðŸŽ¯ User Experience Impact

### Before Implementation
- All students saw all content regardless of their grade level
- No age-appropriate content filtering
- Potential for content too advanced or too basic for student's level

### After Implementation  
- **Grade 4 students**: See Space Exploration + some Earth/Ocean content (grades 4-5)
- **Grade 5 students**: See all current content (grades 4-6) - optimal experience
- **Grade 6 students**: See Earth/Ocean + Chemistry content (grades 5-6)
- **Teachers/Admins**: Retain full access for content management and review

## ðŸ”„ Daily Content Algorithm Integration
The grade filtering seamlessly integrates with the existing daily content selection algorithm:
1. **Daily Selection**: Uses stable hash based on user ID + date for consistent daily picks
2. **Grade Filtering**: Applied before daily selection to ensure appropriate content pool
3. **Shuffle Feature**: Grade filtering also applies to the "next" endpoints for exploration

## âœ… Feature Status: COMPLETE
- âœ… Grade filtering implemented across all 4 content API endpoints
- âœ… Frontend updated to pass user authentication context
- âœ… Role-based access (student filtering vs admin full access)
- âœ… Integration tested with existing daily selection algorithm
- âœ… Edge cases handled (grade boundaries, privileged users)
- âœ… Backward compatibility maintained for existing functionality

The grade-level content filtering system is now fully operational and ready for student use.
