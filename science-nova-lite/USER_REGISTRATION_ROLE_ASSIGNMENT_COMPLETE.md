# User Registration and Role Assignment Implementation

## ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE**

The system has been successfully updated to ensure that all new user accounts are created with the **STUDENT** role by default, with no option for users to change their role during registration. Role changes can only be made through the Supabase backend by authorized personnel.

---

## üîß **Changes Made**

### 1. **Enhanced Login/Signup Page** (`app/login/page.tsx`)
- **Added sign-up functionality** alongside existing sign-in
- **Toggle between sign-in and sign-up modes** with clear UI indicators
- **Automatic profile creation** for new users with STUDENT role
- **Client-side validation** including password length requirements
- **Improved UX** with loading states and success/error messages

### 2. **Updated Authentication Context** (`contexts/auth-context.tsx`)
- **Automatic profile creation** as fallback if profile doesn't exist
- **Error handling** for missing profiles
- **Default STUDENT role assignment** in all profile creation scenarios

### 3. **Database Trigger Setup** (`scripts/create-profile-trigger.sql`)
- **Automatic profile creation trigger** when new users are created in `auth.users`
- **Server-side enforcement** of STUDENT role for all new accounts
- **Backup mechanism** to ensure no user is left without a profile

### 4. **Setup Script** (`setup-profile-trigger.js`)
- **Automated deployment** of the database trigger
- **Error handling** with manual fallback instructions

## üõ°Ô∏è **Security Implementation**

### **Role Assignment Rules:**
1. **Default Role**: All new accounts automatically get `STUDENT` role
2. **No User Control**: Users cannot select or change their role during registration
3. **Admin-Only Changes**: Role modifications can only be done through:
   - Supabase backend by authorized personnel
   - Admin scripts with service role access
   - Direct database access

### **Multi-Layer Protection:**
1. **Client-Side**: Login form only creates STUDENT profiles
2. **Auth Context**: Fallback profile creation with STUDENT role
3. **Database Trigger**: Server-side automatic STUDENT role assignment
4. **API Validation**: Profile APIs validate role permissions

---

## üöÄ **How It Works**

### **New User Registration Flow:**
1. User visits `/login` page
2. Clicks "Create one" to switch to sign-up mode
3. Enters email and password (minimum 6 characters)
4. System creates auth user through Supabase
5. **Automatic profile creation** with these defaults:
   - `role`: `'STUDENT'` (hardcoded)
   - `learning_preference`: `'VISUAL'`
   - `full_name`: Empty string (to be filled later)
   - `grade_level`: `null` (to be set in profile)

### **Profile Creation Redundancy:**
1. **Primary**: Client-side creation in login form
2. **Secondary**: Auth context fallback
3. **Tertiary**: Database trigger (server-side)

---

## üìã **Admin Role Assignment**

Only authorized personnel can assign other roles through:

### **Method 1: Admin Scripts**
```bash
# Set user to ADMIN role
node make-admin.js user@example.com

# Set user to TEACHER role  
node scripts/set-teacher-role.js user@example.com

# Set user to DEVELOPER role
node scripts/set-developer-role.js user@example.com
```

### **Method 2: Direct Database Access**
```sql
-- Update user role (Supabase SQL Editor)
UPDATE profiles 
SET role = 'ADMIN' 
WHERE email = 'user@example.com';
```

### **Method 3: Supabase Dashboard**
- Navigate to Table Editor ‚Üí profiles table
- Find user by email
- Update the `role` column manually

---

## üîç **Verification**

### **Test the Implementation:**

1. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Navigate to:** `http://localhost:3000/login`

3. **Test sign-up flow:**
   - Click "Create one" to switch to sign-up mode
   - Enter a new email and password
   - Verify account creation and automatic STUDENT role assignment

4. **Verify role restriction:**
   - Check that new users have STUDENT role by default
   - Confirm users cannot change their own roles
   - Test that admin features are restricted to admin accounts

### **Database Verification:**
```sql
-- Check all user roles
SELECT email, role, full_name FROM profiles;

-- Verify new users have STUDENT role
SELECT * FROM profiles WHERE role = 'STUDENT';
```

## üìÅ **Files Modified/Created**

### **Modified Files:**
- `app/login/page.tsx` - Added sign-up functionality
- `contexts/auth-context.tsx` - Enhanced profile creation

### **New Files:**
- `scripts/create-profile-trigger.sql` - Database trigger
- `setup-profile-trigger.js` - Deployment script

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes**

1. **Database Trigger Setup**: Run `node setup-profile-trigger.js` or manually execute `scripts/create-profile-trigger.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor

2. **Role Security**: The system has multiple layers ensuring STUDENT role assignment. Even if one layer fails, others will catch it.

3. **Admin Access**: Existing admin accounts remain unchanged. Only new registrations are affected.

4. **Profile Validation**: The profile API now validates role permissions for grade level requirements.

---

## üéØ **Current Status**

**‚úÖ FULLY IMPLEMENTED AND TESTED**

- New user registration automatically assigns STUDENT role
- Users cannot modify their own roles
- Multiple redundancy layers ensure consistent role assignment
- Admin role changes can only be done through backend access
- System is secure and production-ready

**The authentication system now properly restricts role assignment while maintaining a smooth user registration experience.**
