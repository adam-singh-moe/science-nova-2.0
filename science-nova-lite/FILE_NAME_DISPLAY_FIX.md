## ✅ File Name Display Fix - COMPLETED

### 🎯 **Problem Solved:**
The selected file name was not displaying in the upload modal, making it unclear which file was being uploaded.

### 🔧 **Changes Made:**

#### **1. Added File Name State Management**
```tsx
const [selectedFileName, setSelectedFileName] = useState<string | null>(null);
```

#### **2. Enhanced File Input Handler**
- **File Selection**: Captures and stores the file name when a file is selected
- **Validation**: Shows error for non-PDF files and clears file name
- **Reset Logic**: Clears file name when file is deselected

#### **3. Visual File Display**
- **Selected State**: Shows green checkmark icon with file name
- **File Name Display**: Shows full file name with proper text wrapping
- **Change Option**: "Click to change file" instruction for clarity

#### **4. State Reset Management**
- **Modal Close**: Resets file name when modal is closed
- **Modal Open**: Clears previous file name when opening modal
- **Success Upload**: Clears file name after successful upload

#### **5. Enhanced Visual Feedback**
- **Default State**: Gray upload icon with upload prompt
- **Selected State**: Green checkmark with file name
- **Border Colors**: 
  - Default: Gray border
  - Drag Active: Blue border
  - File Selected: Green border

### 🎨 **User Experience Improvements:**

#### **Before Fix:**

2. **State Transitions**:
