# AI Scientist Feature - Grade-Level Restricted Implementation

## Overview
The AI Scientist feature is an intelligent, grade-level appropriate chat interface that provides personalized science education. The system strictly enforces grade-level content restrictions and only uses textbook materials appropriate for the student's grade level.

## üéØ Grade-Level Restrictions

### Content Filtering
- **Questions**: Only grade-appropriate questions are answered

## Technical Implementation

### API Endpoint: `/api/ai-chat`
```typescript
POST /api/ai-chat
{
  "message": string,
  "userId": string
  // Note: gradeLevel is now automatically retrieved from user profile
}
```

**Response:**
```typescript
{
  "response": string,
  "relevantContentFound": boolean,
  "contentSources": number,
  "gradeLevel": number,
  "textbookSources": string[],
  "redirected"?: boolean // True if question was redirected due to grade level
}
```

### üîí Grade-Level Validation
- User's grade level is retrieved from their profile (required)
- Questions inappropriate for grade level are automatically redirected
- Textbook search is restricted to the user's grade level only
- Response complexity is automatically adjusted

### Database Schema
New table: `ai_chat_logs`
- Tracks all AI interactions for analytics
- Includes user context (grade level, learning preference)
- Records textbook content usage

### Key Components

#### 1. AIScientistPage Component
- **Location**: `components/pages/ai-scientist-page.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Real-time chat interface
  - Categorized suggested questions
  - Auto-scrolling message area
  - Learning profile display
  - Textbook content indicators

#### 2. AI Chat API Route
- **Location**: `app/api/ai-chat/route.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Google Gemini AI integration
  - Textbook content search
  - Personalized system prompts
  - Chat logging for analytics

#### 3. Textbook Integration
- Uses existing `textbook-search.ts` functionality
- Embeds relevant content into AI context
- Provides source attribution

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Migration
Run the AI chat logs migration:
```sql
-- Execute scripts/06-ai-chat-logs.sql
```

### 2. Environment Variables
Ensure these are set in your `.env.local`:
```env
GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=your_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### 3. Test the Implementation
```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# In another terminal, test the API
node test-ai-chat.js
```

## Usage Guide

### For Students
1. **Access**: Navigate to `/ai-scientist` (requires login)
2. **Ask Questions**: Type science questions or use suggested prompts
3. **Get Personalized Answers**: Receive responses adapted to your grade level and learning style
4. **See Sources**: When textbook content is used, it's clearly indicated

### For Educators
- All interactions are logged for analytics
- Can track which textbook content is most relevant
- Monitor student engagement patterns

## Suggested Questions Categories

### Biology
- How do plants make their own food?
- How do our bodies digest food?
- Why do animals hibernate?

### Physics
