  * Include dynamic choice prompts for AI-generated context-sensitive options
  * Weight each page's contribution to overall story progress (0.0-1.0)
  * Ensure choices lead to meaningful learning outcomes and exploration

${contentContext ? `CURRICULUM CONTENT:
Use this grade-appropriate content to ensure scientific accuracy. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT mention textbook names, publishers, subject labels, book titles, or reference any educational sources in the story content or image descriptions:

${contentContext}

CRITICAL RULES FOR CONTENT INTEGRATION:
- Never write phrases like "Life Cycles (Biology)", "from the textbook", "according to the book", etc.
- Never mention subject names in parentheses like "(Biology)", "(Physics)", "(Chemistry)"
- Never reference publishers, authors, or educational companies
- Present ALL information as natural discoveries made by ${studentName} during the adventure

‚ùå Subject labels in parentheses like "(Biology)" or "(Chemistry)"
‚ùå Academic phrases like "according to science" or "textbooks tell us"

QUIZ QUESTION GUIDELINES:
- Include quiz questions on pages 2, 4, and any additional even-numbered pages (more questions for longer stories)
- Questions should test understanding of the science concept just introduced in that page
- Use vocabulary and complexity appropriate for Grade ${gradeLevel}
- Provide clear, encouraging explanations for correct answers
- Make incorrect options plausible but clearly wrong to promote learning

DISCUSSION GUIDELINES:
- Create discussion prompts that match Grade ${gradeLevel} comprehension and interest level
- For Grades K-2: Use simple words, relate to everyday experiences, ask about feelings and observations
- For Grades 3-5: Include "what if" scenarios, connections to real world, encourage predictions
- For Grades 6-8: Ask for analysis, comparisons, and deeper connections between concepts
- For Grades 9-12: Include critical thinking, evaluation of evidence, and synthesis of complex ideas
- Always end with encouragement and curiosity-building phrases

IMPORTANT JSON FORMATTING RULES:
- Return ONLY the JSON object, no markdown code blocks, no explanations, no extra text
- Use proper JSON escaping for quotes (\") and newlines (\n)
- Ensure all strings are properly terminated with closing quotes
- Do not include any text before or after the JSON object
- Make sure ALL brackets and braces are properly matched
- End arrays with ] and objects with }
- NEVER include trailing commas after the last array element
- Double-check that every opening brace { has a matching closing brace }
- Double-check that every opening bracket [ has a matching closing bracket ]
- Validate that every property name is in quotes
- Ensure the final closing brace } ends the entire JSON object

JSON STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS:
- The story MUST have exactly 5-6 pages in the "pages" array
- Each page MUST have all required properties: id, title, content, backgroundPrompt
- Each backgroundPrompt MUST avoid any textbook references or subject labels
- The JSON must be complete and valid - incomplete JSON will cause errors

CRITICAL: If you're unsure about JSON syntax, it's better to generate fewer pages than to create invalid JSON!
